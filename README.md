# Inventory Tracker

A simple, CLI inventory management app.
Currently a heavy work-in-progress ortfolio example.

## Features
- Track inventory, customers, and orders.
- Generate reports like current inventory levels and cost, and projections based on available inventory.
- Low inventory alerts, and back order checks. 
- Import data using a csv, although data can also be input manually.
- Export csv backup. 

## Ideas for the Future
Connect to an ecommerce site like Shopify or Etsy, for example. 
Custom wholesale pricing for diffrent customers.
Users and client logins for making orders.

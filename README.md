# Inventory Tracker 

A simple, CLI-based inventory management app.
Currently a heavy work-in-progress portfolio example.
The plan is to expands its features to include wholesale tools, customizations, and multiple users.

## Features
- CRUD for inventory, customers, and orders.
- Generate reports like current inventory levels and cost. 
- Low inventory alerts, and back order checks. 
- Import export inventory and customers using a csv, although data can also be input manually.

## Ideas for the Future
Wholesale management.
Connect to an ecommerce site like Shopify or Etsy, for example. 
User and client logins for making orders.
Cross platform use for web, mobile, and desktop.
